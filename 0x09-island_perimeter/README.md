# Island Perimeter

This project calculates the perimeter of an island represented by a 2D grid.

## Description

The goal of this project is to implement a function that takes a 2D grid representing an island and returns its perimeter. The grid is represented by a matrix of 0's and 1's, where 0 represents water and 1 represents land. The perimeter of the island is the total length of the boundary between the land and water.

## Features

- Calculate the perimeter of an island represented by a 2D grid.
- Handle rectangular and irregular-shaped islands.
- Support islands with holes.
